## Description

```
I found some more random gibberish text. Why are there so many of these?! (Don't answer that, I know why...)

## What I did

```
Upon inspection I struggled a lot with this one since I had no clue what it was.
I checked up on a hash analyzer and it dawned to me that the Ninety One meant something.
I found out that Base91 could be used to decrypt that gibberish text
in which it gave me the flag.
