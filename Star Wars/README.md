If you love Star Wars as much as I do you need to check out this blog!

## What I did

1.  Enter the website.
2.  Sign up and log in.
3.  Make a comment in the post, I notice that the commenting can take in HTML and scripts. I also notice that the admin has to review my comment before accepting it.
4.  I make a script to take the admin's cookie with '<script>var test123=new XMLHttpRequest();test123.open('POST', '/comment/1', true);test123.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');test123.send('content='+document.cookie);</script>'
5.  As soon as the admin finished reviewing the comment, a comment from admin saying his cookie appears.
6.  I copy this cookie, go to the homepage and use EditThisCookie to put that cookie and refresh the page.
7.  The website now shows as if I was the user admin as there's an option on the top right corner that says Admin.
8.  Upon clicking, the flag appears.
