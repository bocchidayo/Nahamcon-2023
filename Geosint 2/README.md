## What I did

```
This time it's an image in a passenger ship that is docked to a port,
rotating around the camera I observed the navy flag code painted on the hull
and when translating it into words, it resulted in IBQZ, using google
we can find that it's a ship currently located in
"Porto di Portoferraio (Ii)

There's another way to solve this by google imaging the castle in the background
in which we can get back to the same place.
