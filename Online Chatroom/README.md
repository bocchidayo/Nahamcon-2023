# Online Chatroom

## Description

```
We are on the web and we are here to chat!
```

## What I did

```
We are given a file named main.go and a website that contains a chatroom
upon inspecting the main.go file, we can find hidden commands such as

"!history"

Upon use, "it shows Error: Please request a valid history index (1 to 6)"

In which I used "!history" from all the way down from 0 until it gave me an error.

Here are the results
