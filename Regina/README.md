# Regina

## Description
```
I have a tyrannosaurus rex plushie and I named it Regina! Here, you can talk to it :)
```

## What I did
```
I have no doubt this was a nightmare for beginners like me
Upon connecting to the server, we are met with a Regina Rexx interpreter.
In which I have no clue about so I go read the documentation that's 200 pages.
Giving up I thought about it until I managed to find something on the documentation.
It should also be noted that to run commands in Regina Rexx interpreter
you have to hit Control-D to execute! So no matter what commands you put
it wont't register unless you Control-D'd
The following is a transcript of the SSH.
